UPGRADING
---------

For upgarding from version 1.1.1 or 1.2 or 1.2.5 or 1.3 or 1.3.5RC1 to version 1.3.5:

1.  Unzip 'couchcms-1.3.5.zip' file to local system. Within the 'couchcms-1.3.5' folder thus
    extracted will be found a folder named 'couch'.
    From within this 'couch' folder' -
    a.  Delete 'snippets' and 'uploads' folders.
    b.  Delete 'config.example.php' file.

2.  Upload the remaining contents of 'couch' folder to your existing installation's 'couch'
    folder (or whatever you might have renamed it to).
    This way we'll be overwriting all existing Couch core files with the newer version
    while preserving anything you might have added to 'snippets' and 'uploads' folder.

3.  If you already have a commercial license for your website,
    append the following line to your site's couch/config.php file:

        define( 'K_PAID_LICENSE', 1 );

IMP. If you have chosen as a security measure to rename the 'index.php' to something else, do
make sure to delete your existing renamed index.php and then rename the new index.php to your
name of choice.
