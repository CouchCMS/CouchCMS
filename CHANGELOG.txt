    * This is the first of the several steps meant to open up Couch's architecture to allow extenting it with external code.

    * This feature can also double up as a menu-maker.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CouchCMS 1.1.1, 30th May. 2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added the ability to create drafts of already published pages.
    * The end-user can now make changes to live pages without the fear of messing up anything or
      his incomplete changes being visible to the world.

- Added support for dynamic folders.
    * The 'template' tag now has a new parameter named 'dynamic_folders' that can be set to '1'
      to allow end users the ability to create and manage folders through the admin panel.

- Made several changes that will now make migration of a Couch managed site to a
  different machine easier (e.g. from local test machine to production server)
    * Items uploaded through the 'image', 'thumbnail' and 'file' type of editable regions
      are no longer stored with the domain names in their paths.
    * Added an import utility script - 'gen_dump.php'. This may be used to create a dump file
      that will be applied automatically during installation. (see documentation for details).

- Enhanced security by now allowing the 'index.php' file within the 'couch' folder to be
  renamed. This will allow only users knowing the new file name to access the admin panel.

- Fixed the error that occured when 'send_mail' tag was used more than once in a template.

- Fixed the bug where the parser was stripping off all backslash characters that had a
  single quote following them.

- Fixed the bug that was causing the Captcha in forms to not appear.

- Increased the length of field storing names of templates to allow names upto 256 chars in length.

- Removed the 'options' directives from .htaccess files. This was causing errors on GoDaddy servers.

- Fixed the bug occurring on some installations of WAMPServer that truncated the ckeditor.js file,
  causing the editor not to show up. Now using PHP to deliver the JavaScript file.

- Upgraded CKEditor to 3.5.4
  Language files may be downloaded from http://www.couchcms.com/ckeditor_354_lang.zip

- Added option in 'config.php' to set location of the default folder to store snippets used by 'embed' tag.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CouchCMS 1.0.1, 11th. Jan. 2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added rebranding feature to CouchCMS.
  Users with commercial license can replace Couch's name and logos with that of their own business.
    * Added lines to config.example.php that can be changed by users to put their own info.

- Added Localization to admin panel
    * Strings used in admin panel now moved to separate file kept in 'lang' folder.
        + Added three locales - EN (default), DE and FR.
        + Users can create their own language files.

- CKEditor
    * Fixed the bug where CKEditor did not appear on non-English locales.
    * Upgraded CKEditor to version 3.5.
    * Added CKEditor 'fr' and 'de' lang files. Rest can be downloaded from
      http://www.couchcms.com/ckeditor_lang.zip
    * Added 'spellchecker' as a valid toolbar button that can be used with 'custom_toolbar'
      parameter of 'editable' tag of type 'richtext'.
    * Added the provision of creating toolbar buttons not natively supported by 'richtext' type
      by prefixing their names with a '#' character.
      This can be used to create, for example, buttons like Scayt, BidiRtl, BidiLtr etc.
      by using them as follows:

          custom_toolbar='cut,copy,paste,pastetext,-,spellchecker,#Scayt,#BidiRtl'

      Note that these names are case-sensitive and should be used exactly as given in CKEditor docs.
      These buttons are not supported by Couch and might not work properly. Also they
      might need further tweaks to couch/includes/ckeditor/config.js file.

- Fixed some warnings that appeared in PasswordHash.php on hosts with paranoid level security
    * This was happening on hosts with functions getmypid and is_readable disabled.

- Added enforce_max parameter to 'editable' tag of type 'thumbnail'.
    * This will allow the created thumbnails to be simply scaled instead of always being cropped.

- Modified 'start_on' parameter of 'pages' tag to use '>=' instead of '>'.
    * This will cause the tag to fetch pages that match the exact time given in 'start_on' also.

- Added 'return_url', 'cancel_url' and 'custom' parameters to 'paypal_button' tag.

- Added 'cc' and 'bcc' parameters to 'send_mail' tag.
