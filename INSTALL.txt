LOCALIZING THE ADMIN PANEL
--------------------------
The default locale of Couch's admin panel is English.
It can be localized to German, French, Spanish or Dutch by changing the following
line in couch/config.php -

    define( 'K_ADMIN_LANG', 'EN' );

to 'DE', 'FR', 'ES' or 'NL' respectively.
All these locales have their respective language files (DE.php, FR.php etc.) present in couch/lang/ folder.
For locales other than these, any of these files can be renamed and modified to create the locale that suits you.
